## Project Overview

The TMS system is a critical part of the shipping and logistics industry, allowing for the purchasing, scheduling, monitoring, and billing of organizations who desire to have cargo shipped via truck or train. The TMS system is designed to be a prototype to help determine the feasibility and core issues of developing a deeper solution for the huge, multinational Fake Corporation.

The TMS solution prototype is a system that allows Fake Shipping Handling and Transportation (FSHT) staff members to manage the order creation, management, and billing process for the company. Specific, high-level functional stories and workflows are as follows:

- Call for, take, and then plan orders from the Contract Marketplace.
- Planning an order requires that the requested cargo be assigned to one or more available Carriers (e.g. Trucking Companies) that FSHT has relationships with.
- Carriers provide the Trips necessary to deliver Orders to their destination.
- Once scheduled, the TMS can simulate the passage of time allowing for updates on the Carrierâ€™s trucks to be requested from the Carrier Update System.
- Once Orders are completed, the TMS system will compute the final bill for the Customer, and post the invoice to the accounts system.
